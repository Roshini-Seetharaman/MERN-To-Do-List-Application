# MERN-To-Do-List-Application
A simple and interactive Full Stack Task Management App built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
This application allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, with all data stored persistently in a MongoDB database.


# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end MERN application, where the frontend (React.js) communicates with the backend (Node.js + Express.js) through RESTful APIs.Tasks are stored and managed efficiently in MongoDB, ensuring persistence across sessions.Itâ€™s designed with a clean and responsive UI, suitable for both beginners learning MERN and developers exploring CRUD operations in a real-world app.

# Features
1.Add new tasks dynamically
2.Delete tasks instantly
3.Persistent task storage using MongoDB
4.RESTful API integration between frontend and backend
5.Responsive and minimal user interface
6.Built with modular and reusable components

# Technologies Used
1.Category	Technologies
2.Frontend	React.js, HTML, CSS
3.Backend	Node.js, Express.js
4.Database	MongoDB, Mongoose
5.Tools	VS Code, Axios, Git & GitHub

# Learning Outcomes
1.Gained hands-on experience in Full Stack (MERN) development
2.Learned to connect frontend and backend using REST APIs
3.Implemented CRUD operations with MongoDB
4.Understood project structure and deployment workflow for MERN apps

# Future Enhancements
